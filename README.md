# Uncommon Dart Bug:  Improper JSON Decoding and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Dart when handling asynchronous API calls and JSON data. The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to fetch data, but it improperly handles JSON decoding and lacks effective error handling. The corrected version is in `bugSolution.dart`.

**Key Issues Addressed:**

* **Improper JSON Decoding:**  The original code assumes the JSON response is always a list (`as List<dynamic>`).  Real-world APIs can return various JSON structures (objects, lists, null values), requiring more flexible and safe decoding.
* **Insufficient Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block is present, but lacks detail in handling errors, logging, or retry mechanisms.  This prevents effective debugging and resilient application behavior.

**Learning Points:**

* Always validate the structure of the JSON response before accessing data.
* Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle unexpected API responses or network issues.  Consider using explicit error types instead of generic exceptions.
* Incorporate retry logic for transient network problems to improve reliability.
